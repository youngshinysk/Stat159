<p>When a group of people work on the same project, it is essential that the project is reproducible
and that team members share their work properly.  It's important that the project is reproducible,
because reproducibility ensures that team members know exactly how other team members got what
they are working on.  Sharing work properly is without a doubt important in a team setting, because
that is the whole point of working in a team, to break up large project for each person to work on and
then combine them all together into one piece later.  There are many computational tool out there
that help achieve this and the ones that will be introduced in this paper are:
terminal (gitbash for windows), makefile, markdown (md), pandoc, git,
github, and text editor (sublime text).  The core of sharing changes you make on your local server
is Git.  Git enables users to keep track of changes and upload the ones they want to share.
In many cases, they will be uploaded to hosting servies like Github.  Git is easily run on terminal
and work will be saved in markdown files and pandoc will be used to combine all of these files
into a nice dynamic report.  Makefile is used to automate these steps.  I will explain each tool
in more detail in the next section.</p>
